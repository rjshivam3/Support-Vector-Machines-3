    "The best regression metric to employ for predicting house prices with an SVM regression model would be the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). RMSE is a popular metric for regression tasks because it provides a measure of how accurately the model predicts the target variable (house prices in this case). It penalizes larger errors more significantly, which is important in housing price predictions where large deviations can be very impactful. RMSE is also in the same units as the target variable, making it easier to interpret.\n",
